Goals for the upcoming year
General Goals
Have meetup locations scheduled 6 mos in advance (ultimate fantasy = year in advance)
Have presentations lined up 6 mos in advance (ultimate fantasy = year in advance)
Determine which OTMs will be at the mtg 4 wks in advance – do a roll call? 
Confirm location, speakers for upcoming mtg 4 wks in advance?
Try to have a good division of labor so that everyone does their share and no one feels over-burdened. This means we will have to share when we feel over whelmed, or if we need to step back for a little while.
